Pingus Level Feedback System

Installing:

  1) Make sure you have installed
     Apache and PHP 4.2+

  2) Uncompress the tar into a directory where Apache
     can see it.

  3) Create directory 'comments' where the script will
     write the xml comment files and MAKE IT WRITABLE
     for Apache.

  4) Create directory 'data' and copy Pingus source directories
     'levels' into it.

  5) Tweak your .htaccess - you might want to deny from all
     comments/* and add "AddType application/pingus-level plf"
